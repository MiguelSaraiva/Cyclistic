# Cyclistic
My capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification.

I took the role of a data analyst on a fictional chicago based bike rental company and was tasked with compiling a business report to help turn casual clients into paid members. The data processing was done using Python and the visualizations using Tableau.
