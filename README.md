# Cyclistic
My capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification.

I took the role of a data analyst on a fictional chicago based bike rental company and was tasked with compiling a business report to help turn casual clients into paid members. The data processing was done using Python and the visualizations using Tableau.

The business report was compiled on the Jupyter notebook that can be found in the Google Drive link above.
